# Project Sunrise
Just a collection of files relating to this project to automate my blinds. 
I used HomeSpan to create the HomeKit integration - kudos to its developers! It's a relly good library. 

The code is very messy, and I'm too lazy to clean them up. Contact me if you have questions! 

I made a YouTube video explaining how I created this project:
